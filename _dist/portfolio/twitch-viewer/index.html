<p>An app used to track the status of various twitch channels. By adding a channel to the front page the user has access to that channel&#39;s current status, live or offline, and additional information about the current broadcast. It should also be noted that this project was inspired by <a href="http://freecodecamp.com">Free Code Camp&#39;s</a> Twitch Tv Front End Development Project.</p>
<h1 id="used">Used</h1>
<p>  Angular (Custom Directives, Factories, Services, Routing), Grunt, Sass, Github Pages</p>
<h1 id="design">Design</h1>
<p>Similar to most of the applications I write, a majority of the layout is first designed in illustrator.</p>
<p>This app is heavily influenced by Google&#39;s Material Design Light Framework. With that said, an overwhelming majority of the application was written without the use of the framework specific code. I specifically liked the way Google displayed information via &quot;cards&quot; so I used a similar design for the channels. The animation on each card was inspired by many projects on Dribble that used interesting animations to transition screens.
<br>
<br>
Here are a few mockups that never made it to the final application.</p>

<p>It took me a really long time to decide on what card design I liked the best. I went back and forth with the card I was going to use. This added many unessecary hours to the development process. Moving forward I understand the importance of pushing my designs closer and closer to a 100% complete layout. I know calling a design 100% is unreasonable as there are always updates and changes but I believe striving for it certainly saves me a significant amount of time. Here are some of the versions I worked with.</p>

<p>In previous projects, mobile screen sizes would quickly expose the limitations of my code. With this project, I made a conscious effort to ensure the mobile experience was on par with the viewing experience on larger devices.</p>
<p>I decided to design a mobile specific version of the site. To implement this, I used media queries and JavaScript code to manipulate the DOM on the initial load and or screen resizing.</p>

<h1 id="challenges">Challenges</h1>
<h2 id="asynchronous-javascript">Asynchronous JavaScript</h2>
<p>Because each channel&#39;s card or component required information from Twitch&#39;s API, many asynchronous  ajax calls were needed. Each ajax call for an individual car&#39;s information took an unknown amount of time to complete. In short, I needed to ensure that certain blocks of code, waited until other blocks of code where complete.</p>
<p>This is where promises came in. Specifically, I used <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all">Promise.all</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/then">Promise.prototype.then</a> statements to control the execution of code.</p>
<h2 id="repeating-components">Repeating Components</h2>
<p>Looking at the design of this app you will see it called for multiple cards that all required similar functionality. Initially I attempted to use built in angular directives to display the cards as if they were a list of information. Unfortunately to implement specific functionality I needed to write a custom directive. Once I understood the syntax and workings of angular directives I was able to write code once and use it for each component.</p>
