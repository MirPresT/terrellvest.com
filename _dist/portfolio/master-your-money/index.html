        <div id="portfolio-post-md-content" class="md-content col"><p>A financial literacy workshop for students of Miramar College. Topics discussed included, budgeting and debt management.</p>
<h1 id="purpose">Purpose</h1>
<p>To a campus administrator our goal was to provide Miramar College students with a foundational understanding of personal finance.</p>
<p>On a more personal level my goal was to provide others with information and an experience I wish I had available.</p>
<h1 id="challenges">Challenges</h1>
<p>Beyond the administrative activities that might come with planning an event on campus, my most significant challenge involved developing the material.</p>
<p>I was tasked with presenting for the first hour of the workshop. The difficulty I encountered was not as a result of having too little information. Rather, I had too much!</p>
<p>To fit everything, I decided to focus on two things. The first being fundamental information that focused on one&#39;s mindset and habits. I felt the technical details would be less significant. The second category I focused on was information that could have an immediate impact on the attendees financial situations.</p>
<p>With information that fit in one of these two categories, I felt I was best positioned to deliver an impactful workshop.</p>
<h1 id="significance">Significance</h1>
<p>This event benefited all participating parties in a manor that hadn&#39;t been done before on campus. I was able to grow as a leader, teacher, and individual. My fellow presenters gained the experience of speaking to 50+ individuals. Attendees received applicable information not available in any class offered at the College. And finally, the college was able to foster the development of it&#39;s students. It was a scenario where everyone benefited.</p>

<h1 id="content">Content</h1>
<p>I created a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/z3ltus7fskrxztv/Master%20Your%20Money%20Quick%20Guide.pdf?dl=0">simple money guide</a> that covers the basics of money management. This is perfect for those that just want the basics, want to make changes quickly, and want something they can refer back to later. <em>Keep in mind this guide is only a suggestion. It is geared towards students just starting out in their professional endeavours.</em></p>
<h1 id="looking-back">Looking back</h1>
<p>The one thing I&#39;d change is my preparation for the presentation. I say this with complete confidence that the delivery I gave was completely appropriate. However, I would have spent more time planning out interaction with the audience.</p>
<h1 id="moving-forward">Moving Forward</h1>
<p>My initial goal with this event was to simply provide others with information. A completely reasonable goal. However, I now know that goal was incomplete.</p>
<p>Sharing information with those who may need it is easy. The problem is we don&#39;t utilize information simply because it was shared with us. Moving forward, my new goal for similar events will be as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="bold">
  Illustrate the value behind the information being delivered. Illustrate The benefits of utilizing such information. And allow others to get excited about the results.
