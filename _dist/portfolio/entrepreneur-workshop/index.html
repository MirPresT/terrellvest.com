        <div id="portfolio-post-md-content" class="md-content col"><p>The Miramar Business Club hosted an event on campus to address student interest in entrepreneurship as a potential career path. A panel of local small business owners discussed their experience and provided valuable insight.</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/images/exploring-entrepreneurship/Panel.jpg" class="landscape full"></p>
<h1 id="personal-contributions">Personal Contributions</h1>
<p>As the President of the Miramar Business Club I took the responsibility of both planning and hosting the event. I coordinated with club members, school administrators, and outside individuals to ensure it was a success.</p>
<h1 id="significance">Significance</h1>
<p>Miramar College has a significant amount of individuals interested in pursuing careers in business. Many of which aspire to own their own businesses. Unfortunately, the college does little to support or satisfy this interest. The list of courses applicable to entrepreneurship range between rare to nonexistent.</p>
<p>With that said, I went into this with the understanding that a single event would do little in the way of teaching specific skillsets necessary to succeed. Such ideas and concepts take time to master.</p>
<p>Rather, it was my intention to illuminate the world of entrepreneurship for students. I wanted attendees to be able to get a better sense for what starting a business actually entailed. In today’s world “Entrepreneur” is such a buzz word that the true meaning has been skewed.

<h1 id="challenges">Challenges</h1>
<p>Looking back my biggest challenge was completely different than I had expected. It wasn’t coordinating with speakers, submitting proposals, working with administration, or even speaking at the event.</p>
<p>My biggest challenge was understanding what and how to delegate the work necessary for a large event. Many times when this happens it’s because of a lack of trust in the people around you. That was not the case.</p>
<p>Instead I simply misjudged what was needed to be done and the potential roadblocks.</p>
