My goal for this website is to provide you with an introduction. An introduction to me, the skillsets I possess and most importantly the content I produce.</p>

<p>Outside of the classroom I have completed numerous projects that display my skillset and ability. With only two courses left at Miramar, I have applied to continue my education at San Diego State University in the Fall of 2016. I am pursuing a degree in Finance.</p>
<p>I code applications, mainly on the web. Feel free to take a look at full descriptions of various projects. It is my desire and complete intension to pursue projects that utilize my soft skills, financial savvy, and engineering skills. For those interested, here is a direct link to my resume.</p>
