        <div id="blog-post-md-content" class="col"><p>In 2015, I decided to act with greater intent. So, in January I made a list of things I wanted to accomplish. This post is a reflection of how the year went. It’s about the goals I set out to achieve and the lessons I learned along the way.</p>
<h2 style="margin-left:32px">List Completion</h2>

<ul class="tasks">
  <li>
    <svg id="check">
      <use xlink:href="../../assets/images/sprites/sprites.svg#blue-check">
    </svg>
    <span>Begin establishing credit via first credit card</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <svg id="check">
      <use xlink:href="../../assets/images/sprites/sprites.svg#blue-check">
    </svg>
    <span>Open and fund an investment account</span>
  </li>
  <li>Go to the gym at least 3 days every week of the year</li>
  <li>Make money selling my own product or service</li>
  <li>Create and write posts for a Blog</li>
  <li>Get Straight A’s (Almost)</li>
  <li>
    <svg id="check">
      <use xlink:href="../../assets/images/sprites/sprites.svg#blue-check">

    <span>Host a Financial Literacy workshop</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <svg id="check">
      <use xlink:href="../../assets/images/sprites/sprites.svg#blue-check">

    <span>Present to the San Diego Community College District Board of Trustees</span>
  </li>
  <li>Apply to 50 Scholarships</li>
  <li>
    <svg id="check">
      <use xlink:href="../../assets/images/sprites/sprites.svg#blue-check">
    </svg>
    <span>Apply to San Diego State University</span>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>As much as I wish I’d nailed everything on the list, the mere pursuit ended up being extremely valuable. For example, I didn’t get all A’s but I still did better than I ever had in the past. I skipped many days at the gym but was still there almost every week.</p>
<div id="blog-statement">Set your goals high for if you miss you’ll still be ahead of where you started</div>

<p>A year is a long time. Things change. To my surprise, I ended up accomplishing a lot that was never on my initial list.</p>
<div class="gen-list-container">
  <h2 class="gen-list-heading">Business Club</h2>
  <ul class="gen-list">
    <li class="list-item">Created a Social Media Guide and website critique for a Non Profit</li>
    <li class="list-item">Hosted an Entrepreneur Workshop on campus</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="gen-list-container">
  <h2 class="gen-list-heading">Coding</h2>
  <ul class="gen-list">
    <li class="list-item">Spent 500+ hrs coding - This was my favorite by far</li>
    <li class="list-item">Designed this website</li>
    <li class="list-item">Toured Sony&#39;s Office</li>
    <li class="list-item">Attended 5+ Coding Meetups</li>
    <li class="list-item">Served as a Teachers Aid in two classes teaching kids how to code</li>
  </ul>
</div>


<div class="gen-list-container">
  <h2 class="gen-list-heading">Phi Theta Kappa Honors Club</h2>
  <ul class="gen-list">
    <li class="list-item">Elected Treasurer of Phi Theta Kapa (Honors Society)</li>
    <li class="list-item">Presented with PTK Officers at Honors Symposium</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="gen-list-container">
  <h2 class="gen-list-heading">School</h2>
  <ul class="gen-list">
    <li class="list-item">Applied for 6 Scholarships</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>Each of these items presented themselves throughout the year. For example, I would have never guessed I&#39;d become an officer with an honors club or find a passion for web development. These were never on my radar yet I found great value in each of them.</p>
<div id="blog-statement">Plan, but be flexible. Some of the best opportunities come out of nowhere.</div>

<p>These types of lists are great, but they fail to show the entire picture. My intent is to present a more complete and truthful illustration of the year. Here is a list of things I did that most people conveniently forget to share.</p>
<div class="gen-list-container">
  <h2 class="gen-list-heading">The not so good</h2>
  <ul class="gen-list">
    <li class="list-item">I let nerves get the best of me during numerous speeches</li>
    <li class="list-item">I bombed two important exams</li>
    <li class="list-item">I completed at least five series on Netflix</li>
    <li class="list-item">I transitioned out of a career path</li>
    <li class="list-item">I annoyed some people</li>
    <li class="list-item">I made others angry</li>
    <li class="list-item">I watched my investments go down in value</li>
    <li class="list-item">I made less than 5% of the income I made the previous year</li>
    <li class="list-item">I came up with countless excuses to avoid the gym</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>If I could go back and prevent the above events from happening, I probably would. Unfortunately, it&#39;s not possible. The challenge isn&#39;t preventing every negative event from ever happening. The challenge is reducing the total number of negative events that occur. It&#39;s dealing with them when they do occur. It&#39;s managing their impact and more significant than any, it&#39;s accepting responsibility.</p>
<p>Instead of being perfect every day, I aim to simply win more days than I lose. What is a win? To me a win is a day that I learn something. It&#39;s a day that I provide value, or a day that I take a step closer to my goal. And by winning more days than I lose, I guarantee progress.</p>
<div id="blog-statement">Simply win more days than you lose</div>

<p>2015 has been an interesting year. The sequence of events is one that I would have never predicted. However, I&#39;m extremely grateful for how it turned out and eager for all that is to come.</p>
<p class="own-line">Here&#39;s to a successful 2016</p>
