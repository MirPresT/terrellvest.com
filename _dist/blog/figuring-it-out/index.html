        <div id="blog-post-md-content" class="md-content col"><p>Upon graduating high school I began chasing an idea. I needed to know how I was going to spend the rest of my life. I needed to &quot;figure it out&quot;.</p>
<p>What degree do I need? What If I don&#39;t like it? What is my passion? Can I only do one thing? How do I know? These were just a few of the questions stressing me out. I have since realized that this way of thinking is unhelpful and all too familiar among college students.</p>
<h2 class="solo">I propose an alternative</h2>

<p>Try a lot of things while the consequences are still low. Move quickly towards things that interest you. Ignore the negative self-talk. Getting good grades just isn&#39;t enough. After some exploration check how you feel. Does the thought of doing whatever you’ve been exploring excite you? If it does, press on the gas pedal! Lean into it! Explore possibilities for advancement and be open to opportunity or challenge. Before you know it you will look up and realize how improved things are from just 3, 6, or even 12 months ago.</p>
<p>If your current situation does not excite you, ask yourself why? What would you change? How do you change it and would things be better if you did?</p>
<h2 class="solo">It&#39;s ok to shift lanes.</h2>

<p>This is where council from people you respect may come in handy. Remember, you have more control than you think.</p>
<p>The idea of working for a company for 20-30+ years is a rarity. It’s not wrong, it’s just no longer the way things are. Be flexible, take
chances, and welcome challenge.</p>
<p>Before you know it you will have the next couple years &quot;figured out&quot;.</p>
