I am going to type a lot of text so that I can see how the paragraphs are being rendered to to html. This is really cool that I can type my text like this and everything just works. I really like templating languages much better than writing react components for static sites like this.</p>
<h2 id="sub-header">Sub Header</h2>
<p>One more paragraph to see how things space out. Why didn&#39;t the title show up in the correct location? How Am I going to organize my jade templates and markdown so they correspond to each other and I can tell what variables are being passed in? Maybe I use a function to pass in things like the location of the rendered files so that the user can specify where the files need to be rendered from and where they need to be rendered to. Live rendering and building of my blog post. Dope</p>
