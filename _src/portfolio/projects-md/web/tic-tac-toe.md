Play “Tic Tac Toe” against the computer. The computer's skill level can be set to various difficulties.

Choose easy and the computer will play in random locations. Pick regular and the computer will only react to certain conditions. Finally, if you set the difficulty to impossible, the computer will make the most ideal move every single time. Each game will result in a tie or a loss!

I dare you to try and beat the computer on impossible mode.

## Build With

React, Flux, Grunt, & Browserify.

## Design

Overall layout and page design was created in Photoshop while some individual elements were created in Illustrator.

This app was partially Inspired by Google's Material Design.


## Challenges
This was the first application I built using both React and Flux. Previously I had only used Angular v1.x +.

Writing the logic for the computer in both the regular and impossible game modes proved to be more challenging than expected. The application had to be setup so that each time the user made a move, the computer evaluated the state of the board and made the best move.

After writing the entire app, It was brought to my attention that algorithms exist for implementing such logic. However, the code and ideas used in this application came strictly from my analysis of many, many tic-tac-toe games.
