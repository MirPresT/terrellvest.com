This is my personal Website. A place where I show off my work, blog about my process, and post content for others to see. Keep reading to learn more about the creation process and technology used to build it.

## Built With
Node, Gulp, React, Markdown, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Design

The current design of the site is version two of an initial idea I came up with. Its simple, focused, and clean.

Approximately 90% of the design was created in Photoshop with various adjustments made in the browser. A handful of elements were drafted in Illustrator as well.

This site can handle screen resizing and usage across multiple devices. If you don't believe me, test it!

## Static Site Generation
Every page on this website is created prior to deployment. I use Gulp and Node to execute a custom Promise based build process written in JavaScript;

This process builds the main pages as well as the blog and portfolio posts.

## Hosting & Deployment
This site is hosted on a Digital Ocean server with a NGINX configuration. * Special thanks to [GUS SUAREZ](http://mythril.co/) for aiding in the initial setup.
