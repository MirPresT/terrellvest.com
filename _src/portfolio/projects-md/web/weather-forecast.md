This was the second app I had ever designed in illustrator. I went through many prototypes and mockups before I came up with something I felt appropriate.

This app uses many concepts outlined in Google's material design documentation. A few Material Design Light components are used. The advantage with this is the theoretical decrease in coding time. However, I found it difficult working with pre defined components that achieved styling I didn't understand. I've since opted to only use components I could create myself.


# Challenges
The motivation behind this project involved learning how to make and handle ajax requests to an external api. The code is not organized properly and doesn't always achieve the intended goal in an efficient manor. Because I did not use angular, react or any other common front end framework, I relied heavily on jquery. This is a practice I've since grown out of.
