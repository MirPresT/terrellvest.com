## Build

Sass, Vanilla JavaScript

## Design

This app was designed predominantly in Illustrator.

It uses many concepts outlined in Google's material design documentation. A few Material Design Light components are used. The advantage with this is the theoretical decrease in coding time. However, I found it difficult working with pre defined components. Styling them was a pain. I've since opted to lean towards coding small components myself.


## Other Notes

The motivation behind this project involved learning how to make and handle ajax requests to an external api. (This was essentially just my second project into JavaScript Development)
