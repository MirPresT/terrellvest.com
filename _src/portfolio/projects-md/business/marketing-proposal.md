The Miramar Business club partnered with one of the largest nonprofits in San Diego. In this partnership our club developed a project to help SAY San Diego, promote their organization in the local community.

## Objectives
More specifically, the goal of this project was to increase awareness, share information, and tell their story to other businesses in San Diego with the goal of increasing donor support.

## Projects
To satisfy these objectives we set out to create a social media guide along with a website critique. Both projects followed a timeline identical to the one below.

<div class="num-list-container">
  <h2 class="list-heading">Timeline</h2>
  <ol class="numbered-list">
     <li>Meet with Say San Diego to identify pain points</li>
     <li>Develop a project proposal that outlines the best way to address such points</li>
     <li>Organize and begin creation of deliverables</li>
     <li>Present finished projects on-site</li>
  </ol>
</div>

## Social Media Guide
A 10-page pdf that would allow a staff member to quickly understand the basics of appropriate posting on social media. It covered everything from the mindset behind gaining an audience to the specifics of posting on a particular platform. In other words, it outlined both the philosophy and the tactics. This guide has since been used as a resource for new staff members. Here are two pages from the guide.

## Website Critique
A presentation and outlined document illuminating pain points on SAYâ€™s current website. This addressed overall marketing strategy, navigation issues, and general usability improvements. SAY used this document and presentation to immediately begin updates to their website. Below is a sample page from the critique.

## Roles and Contributions
As the President of the Miramar college business club I lead both projects from their inception to their presentation. Throughout the process I also managed communication with SAY. However, various club members made significant contributions to both projects.

Angel Torres, a club officer, significantly contributed to the design of the social media guide. My contributions centered around the content, flow or layout within the guide, and final presentation.

For the website critique I simply provided guidance and presentational assistance. The rest of the significant contributions came from Joshua Nunn and Andrew Clark. Both individuals conducted research, aided in the creation of the written documentation, and lead the final presentation of the project.

## Significance
Both the social media guide and the website critique served as valuable resources to SAY in their effort to develop a more in depth online marketing strategy. This project also benefited the students participating. It allowed us to develop our skills beyond a class room environment. I got to lead meetings with business professionals and present finished projects.
