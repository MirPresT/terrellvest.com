My name is Terrell Vest. My goal for this website is to provide you with an introduction. An introduction to me, the skillsets I possess and most importantly the content I produce.

Over the last 2 and a half years I have completed numerous projects outside of the class room. With just two courses left, I have applied to SDSU as a Finance major.

Outside of the classroom I have completed numerous projects that display my skillset and ability. With only two courses left at Miramar, I have applied to continue my education at San Diego State University in the Fall of 2016. I am pursuing a degree in Finance.

I code applications, mainly on the web. Feel free to take a look at full descriptions of various projects. It is my desire and complete intension to pursue projects that utilize my soft skills, financial savvy, and engineering skills. For those interested, here is a direct link to my resume.
