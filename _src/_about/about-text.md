My name is Terrell Vest. I am a college student with an expertise in the areas of personal finance and front end web development. In other words, I enjoy developing applications, and teaching people about money.

At Miramar College, I am the President of the Business Club and Treasurer of the Phi Theta Kappa Miramar chapter (International Honors Society). I will graduate this spring with an Associates Degree in Business. In the Fall of 2016 I begin the remaining two years of my undergraduate degree at San Diego State University.

On my [portfolio page](/portfolio) is a collection of projects I've completed that display my professional and technical skillsets. You will see a list of the most recent applications I've built along with various projects I've lead as the Business Club President.

Additionally, I am exploring Front End Development and Finance related internships. View my [resume](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lcjszjzyq0ymcly/Resume.docx?dl=0) or [get in touch](/contact).
