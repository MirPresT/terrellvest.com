# Personal Website

This is a newly redesigned and simplified version of terrellvest.com. I moved away from a wordpress.org setup and theme to a personally designed and developed site.

I wrote a unique build process in node.js that allows me to maintain both a portfolio and blog with posts composed in markdown.

For more info on the development of this site, view [the writeup](https://terrellvest.com/portfolio/personal-website/).

## Development Notes

To build this site use either of the commands listed below. The gulp task will build the entire site, and start the development server. Pushing changes to master will automatically update the live site.
```sh
npm run dev
```
or
```sh
gulp
```
